# Detection of Interstitial Lung Disease Using Radiologists' Notes and Medical Claims Data

For our capstone project, my MScA partners and I decided to focus on the topic of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). 
Our project was comprised of three main components:
1. Automated summarization of radiologists' notes
2. ML model that would predict occurrence of ILD using notes summaries
3. ML survival model that would predict when ILD would occur in members

I focused on the third component, the survival modeling to predict when a patient would receive an ILD diagnosis. The following represents that work.

## Modeling
For random survival forest modeling, I used a few packages in R.
